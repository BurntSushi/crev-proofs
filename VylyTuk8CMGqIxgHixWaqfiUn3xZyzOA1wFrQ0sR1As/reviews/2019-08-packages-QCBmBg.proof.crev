  I wrote this crate, so this review is a reflection as a result of writing
  the code and then reviewing it again for this review.
  
  The entire purpose of the memchr crate is to do this:
  
      haystack.iter().position(|&b| b == needle)
  
  ... but really fast. As a result, this crate uses SIMD via CPU specific
  vendor intrinsics. Consequently, there is a lot of unsafe code in this
  crate. There is really no way to avoid this, other than perhaps using a
  higher level platform independent SIMD API. But no such thing of sufficient
  quality exists for stable Rust at the time of writing.
  
  The testing strategy is the most important bit here. In particular, every
  public API item is tested using a permutation of tests that exercise all
  possible alignments found in a haystack. (Because the implementations used
  aligned loads/stores, which are only correct if the address arithmetic is
  correct.) Additionally, there are quickcheck tests that act as a sort of
  fuzzer guaranteeing that the implementation is correct for a range of inputs.
  
  I gave the highest rating possible because of the extensive use this crate
  has seen, in addition to its level of testing. In particular, memchr
  underlies a significant chunk of all text search in the Rust ecosystem.

  I wrote this crate, so this review is a reflection as a result of writing the
  code and then reviewing it again for this review.
  
  While the aho-corasick crate is not often used directly, it is a key
  optimization technique used in the `regex` crate for quickly finding
  potential matches by searching literals.
  
  I gave this crate a rating of `positive` instead of the highest `strong`
  because it was somewhat recently rewritten. So it hasn't been thoroughly
  vetted yet.
  
  At a higher level, one concern point of this crate is that it has a lot of
  `unsafe` usage. While a small number of those `unsafe` uses are for the
  Aho-Corasick algorithm itself---mostly for explicitly eliding bounds checks
  for performance reasons---the vast majority of all `unsafe` uses are for the
  implementation of the Teddy algorithm, which makes heavy use of SIMD through
  explicit CPU specific vendor intrinsics. The Teddy algorithm is used as a
  fast prefilter to quickly find potential matches when searching for a smaller
  number of patterns. The speedups can be an order of magnitude, so the extra
  code complexity is worth it.
  
  As with the memchr crate, both the Aho-Corasick algorithm and the Teddy
  algorithm are thoroughly tested. Both are tested independently of one another
  and when they are used together. Like the memchr crate, the Teddy
  algorithm is tested on a wide variety of haystack configurations to test
  different haystack lengths and match positions, all of which can exercise
  different aspects of the Teddy algorithm. If one counted the total number of
  tests for the entire crate (including variations on each), it would easily
  be in the tens of thousands.

  I wrote this crate, so this review is a reflection as a result of writing
  the code and then reviewing it again for this review.
  
  The regex-syntax crate is mostly an internal implementation detail of the
  regex crate. It is exposed as a stand-alone crate for the occasional use
  case where it is convenient to analyze the syntax of a regex. The primary
  thing that the regex-syntax crate provides is a parser for the concrete
  syntax supported by the `regex` crate.
  
  The regex-syntax crate is very large, but there is no unsafe used anywhere.
  Moreover, it has no dependencies. That means that no matter what concrete
  syntax is given, the worst that can happen is a panic. Memory safety should
  be preserved (modulo bugs in the compiler or the standard library). On top of
  that, the parser does not use explicit recursion and enforces a nest depth
  by default, so it should generally be safe with respect to arbitrary input.

  This crate was written by Amanieu d'Antras in response to my efforts to make
  thread safe caching in the regex crate faster. The way to think about it is
  "dynamic" thread local storage.
  
  The crate does use a fair amount of unsafe, and the reason for this is to
  minimize latency as much as is possible. Each use of unsafe isn't
  particularly tricky---it's mostly managing atomic access to a hash table.
  With that said, it would be nice if each use of unsafe had a comment
  explaining/justifying it. There are some comments scattered about making
  reasonable arguments, but more would be good.
  
  This crate did have an issue a while back where if a program used the same
  regex (for example) many times from many short lived threads, then the
  cached data could grow without bound. Amanieu patched that issue a while
  back by reusing thread ids. A thread id is tracked using normal TLS, which
  is dropped when the thread is destroyed.
  
  I gave this crate a rating of positive because I cannot identify any issues
  after reviewing the code, although, I am not completely certain that there
  are no issues because of the use of unsafe code.

  I wrote this crate, so this review is a reflection as a result of writing the
  code and then reviewing it again for this review.
  
  I gave a rating of positive because the implementation in the regex crate has
  remain mostly unchanged for a long period of time, so it has matured and been
  battle tested. Moreover, the crate uses very little unsafe directly. The
  only uses are in the DFA regex engine for explicitly eliding bounds checks
  in very hot loops.
  
  A better rating is likely deserved, but there are still a few outstanding
  bugs that can produce incorrect matches. In many cases, these bugs are a
  result of optimizations using literal searches, which can be subtle and
  difficult to get right.

  The 1.4.0 release removes the hand-rolled unreachable hint in favor of
  `unreachable_unchecked`, which was a new API introduced in Rust 1.27.
  Otherwise, nothing substantial was changed, other than allowing some
  deprecated APIs to support older versions of Rust.
